"Inspired by a comment on this sub where a guy said he called the police and told them his classmate was naughty, I created this post so we can all share our experiences with pao toh kias. 

In primary 5 there was this guy who would pee in a weird way. He would pull his pants down to his knee, and then not hold his dick with his hand, instead he would just put both hands on his hips and kind of thrust his pelvis toward the urinal so that he was closer. 

So me and other boys would make fun of him by pretending to do that pose he did. He then told our teacher what we did, and what exactly we were making fun of. This was a female teacher, and he was telling her how he stands when he pees and how we are mean for making fun of that. Luckily she just told all of us involved not to talk to one another, and no action was taken.

"So I've lived in Singapore most of my life but my family never became Permanent Residents. After graduating high school I went abroad for college, and I'd visit my family on short-term passes most summer/winter breaks.

So I spent a few weeks back in Singapore this summer before going to Hong Kong to visit a friend for a week. After that I came back here since school doesn't start until later this month. When I got to immigration the lady was immediately unfriendly, but I've encountered my fair share of unfriendly airport agents and everything usually turned out fine.

She asked me the same sorta questions I usually got, but any time I misunderstood a question or she couldn't hear me or something she'd raise her voice or give me a rude response. I hadn't even done anything but she seemed generally pissed for whatever reason. Since it was like 2am and I was tired, I tried to be polite so I could move on and get home as soon as possible.

I took out my phone to check the time, and when I turned it off it made a click sound (just like all iPhones do), and when the lady heard it her demeanor suddenly flipped. She accused me of taking a photo (even though I didn't) and demanded I delete it. I showed her the Photo app on my phone so she could see there wasn't a photo of her, then she just grabbed my phone and went through it herself. When she gave it back I even showed her how the click was just from the phone turning off, but she completely ignored me.

From there her behavior just got so much worse, and her questions more accusatory. She noticed I was just in Singapore last week and asked what I was doing back so soon. I told her it was because my family lives here. I even had a return ticket for when I go back to school. She told me I needed to go to the office to get a secondary inspection (aka I was being detained). She didn't move and I didn't know where to go so I asked if I should follow her, and she yelled back ""How else are you supposed to get there if you don't follow me?""

Then when we were passing by all the other travelers waiting in line at immigration, she yelled out ""If you go traveling, don't throw tantrums"" for everyone to hear. I don't get why she had to humiliate me like that. By ""tantrums"" I assume she was referring to the imaginary photo I took of her so that I could later shame her on social media or whatever.

Anyway, she took me to another counter. I was getting pretty nervous so I started tapping my fingers against the counter, and the male agent gave me a hard look and in a harsh tone he told me to stop. At this point I was worried all the agents would treat me like some sort of suspicious criminal, but thankfully the actual agents that did my secondary inspection were much more polite. They asked me some questions, then asked for my mom's EP details and phone number so that they can contact her to confirm the answers I gave them (our address, my status as a student, even the fact that she was my mom, etc). They took me to a waiting room while they called my mom, and eventually they came back in and told me I was free to go with a 30-day pass. I asked them if I was in any trouble. They told me I wasn't and that this was just normal immigration protocol, even though nothing about it felt remotely normal.

After the whole experience I just felt really dehumanized. I used to think of Singapore as my home but now it feels like I'm not even allowed here. I'm Filipino, which I know is kind of a red flag but I figured since I used to live here and even have family living here that I wouldn't have any issues.

I still plan on visiting my family in the future (likely twice a year), but I'm worried about this whole situation affecting my travel plans. Will I be flagged as a suspicious person whenever I come back? I'm wondering if the immigration agent could've even flagged me as ""difficult"" or ""insubordinate"" or something. I'm just scared about having a bad mark on my record and going through this whole thing all over again.",casual

"I know Singaporeans love saying complaining is a national pastime, but I disagree with the notion that it's a defining trait of Singaporeans. It's more a defining trait of anyone with a phone.

I've talked to a lot of people (as recently as a few days ago) whose impression of Singaporeans is about how they complain too much (on the internet), and I usually counter it with ""how is that any different from whiny comments on popular news articles in your country?"" As a foreigner myself, I find the social media comments from my home country (India) in news posts way worse than what I see here in Singapore. The sheer amount of pettiness, whininess, stupidity and negativity is staggering. And in multiple languages too.

That said, what with the comments from Nas Daily, and how Singaporeans are getting a lot of flak for being whiny in the comments, is the ""whiny Singaporean"" perception really accurate? Local Singaporeans who haven't lived outside (traveling doesn't really count, imho) would definitely say it's true, but as with any local population with limited exposure to bread-and-butter issues of other countries, it's easy to assume any common behaviour as uniquely Singaporean.

Singaporeans who live overseas though, what do you think?

Edit: sorry, my wording is a little confusing. My question essentially is: **Do Singaporeans whine about domestic issues in Singapore (cost of living, transport breakdowns etc) more than say the British do about similar things in the UK, or the Germans do in Germany, or Venezuelans in Venezuela?**",casual

The cultures and religions in Singapore are less accepting of homosexuality than that of those in India. We also have even more conservative religious neighbours that have significant ties to us.

There's not much accountability to force the change so the homophobes might not fear it as much. It also helps that historically, Indian culture doesn't hate homosexuality.

None of what the guy said is a conspiracy, it's all happening in plain sight. 

&gt;Didn't a few hate priests get denied permission to come and speak here?

Yes, but only because the priests insulted **other religions**. If they spoke out against LGBTs they would not have faced any actions. 

&gt; The issue here is just whether they're willing to use that organization and activism for the other 364 days in the year besides the pink dot rally. 

The groups behind PinkDot are doing that. It's just not as heavily reported on as Pinkdot itself. 

&gt; And reasonable activism, not ""if you don't support gay rights you are a monster and a backwards caveman"" 

But religious people have a tendency to shift goal posts and redefine what constitutes as 'reasonable' then. When one group is oppressing another, asking for equality or fairness might come off as radical simply because a comprise would still work in the oppressor's favor.

"Actually mosques work quite differently from churches. There are no organised cell groups and such. Most people just go to any mosque every Friday to pray. It isnt fixed nor do you have an affiliation unless you work at the mosque. Volunteering is on a very ad hoc basis as well

Anyway perception in the Muslim community has chaged drastically compared to more than 10 years ago. Sermons on Fridays have been trying to promote inclusivity and tolerance for the LGBT community, basically saying they are people as well and should not discriminate. Treating them as equals as a sermon message is really a big progress from not addressing the issue at all.

Only thing is that mosques in SG try to stay away from politics. MUIS is always very careful in their sermons, and that includes not outrightly criticising policies. Mosques are very aware of the vulnerable position of Muslims in SG so they would rather Muslims not make the news 

The other thing is that most Muslims in SG dont really listen to sermons. You take a look around in a mosque on Friday and you can see most people are distracted or nodding off or just sleeping.

The big issue is that on the ground. The traditional bloc is always more vocal than the progressive one. And fillial piety and respecting elders is a very big thing in the Malay/Muslim community. If you have been taught that heaven lies at the feet of your mother and it comes down to calling her out on her discriminatory views vs keeping mum or just giving a slight nudge. Youre going to bet that most of them wouldnt call these orang lama out. So people who are generally unaffected by the issue or those who do not have strong views (""soft and gentle""). Instead of saying ""Sure why not it doesnt affect me anyway"" they still will feel uncomfortable voting to repeal because they think everyone around them disagrees and they are afraid of disagreement/disrespekting their elders/their community

Hardly true. Women are allowed to serve in the army if they wish to.",casual
"Well, yeah. But I believe that the more controversial and relevant part about NS, which is the fact that only men are legally required to undergo it, is the thing under discussion here. I'd have thought that was obvious given the nature of this post and the other comments.",casual
"I'm not disputing the controversy of NS, I'm disputing your statement that the discrimination is two ways.

For it to be a two way discrimination, men would be forced to serve, but women are seen as too weak to serve and cannot join the army even if they wanted to.

In this case, the discrimination is solely one way. Men are perceived to be stronger, and thus are forced to serve NS. However some women are also perceived to be as strong, and are therefore also allowed to serve in the army if they wish to. Where's the discrimination against women?",casual
"&gt; Men are perceived to be stronger

""Stronger"" is a comparative. For one group to be seen as stronger, the other would have to be less strong, i.e. weaker. There you go, there's your discrimination. You even admit it yourself:

&gt; *Some* women are perceived to be as strong

Only ""some"". Yet *all* men are perceived to be strong enough. The women who are seen as strong enough to join up are the exceptions, not the rule; the vast majority are still ""too weak"". For us to be able to say that there isn't discrimination/minimal discrimination, women as a whole should be perceived and treated the same as men as a whole.

Using the fact that there are some women who are perceived to be as strong as men as evidence that there isn't discrimination is like saying that just because America has had an African-American president, racism there no longer exists.",casual
"So how does that discriminate against women? They are given the choice to join the army or not join the army. Are they being denied anything? What opportunities are they being denied?

Why should women even be treated as the same as men? It is a biological fact that women are physically weaker than men. To deny that is simply being delusional of reality. Isn't the fact that women are given equal opportunities to serve in the army good enough?

If anything, men are still the ones being discriminated against. All men are expected to be strong and have to serve and have no choice in the matter.",casual
"You're not getting my point of perception vs treatment.

I totally agree that men are discriminated against. They're treated worse. From another point of view, for the exact same reason, women are discriminated against. They're perceived to be worse. The latter doesn't have much to do with laws and regulations; rather, it's about mindsets that are ingrained in society and have psychological effects, not physical ones.

For equality, it should be compulsory for both men and women to serve NS (or neither, but I err on the side that our defence would be a mess without NS, which is a separate argument). Taking into account the biological fact that women are weaker, perhaps women can serve in less physically strenuous vocations? Equity, then, not equality.

Can you provide high profile cases of where NS has caused an entity to wrongly assume that a woman is weaker, leading to that entity discriminating against that woman and denying her an opportunity that she was capable of handling?",casual
"Okay, let me try to rephrase my point in this thread: 

How you treat someone is based on how you perceive them, whether that perception has a factual basis or not. If you perceive someone to be weak, you would treat them better to protect them or because you think they can't handle something. So men are treated worse (regarding NS requirements) because they are perceived to be stronger. Women are treated better (no compulsory NS) because they are perceived to be weaker.

When it comes to NS, I'm only considering the fact that it's compulsory for men only. The reason why it isn't compulsory for women too is because women are seen as too weak to handle the training. Maybe they are biologically, but they could be posted to less physically strenuous vocations instead. Of course it is acknowledged that some women are strong enough, hence the voluntary enlistment, but 'some' does not equal 'all'.

NS itself isn't discriminatory towards women; it's the mindset behind it that is. ",casual

Whether you see it as the beggar benefiting because he suddenly became half a million dollars richer or that the regular working person not benefitting as he did not get anything does not matter. It's the fact that the billionaire threw the half million at the beggar. Depending on who you ask, that act can be seen as an insult to the beggar. ",casual

I have always found the best way to deal with most questions is to tie to back to a core story (this isn't really a real interview technique but adapted from another discipline) - I go into the interview with a very prepared and consistent story of who I am, why am I good at, what can I bring to the table, and what I am looking for. no matter how strange the question is, even if I give a slightly weak answer, as long as I tie it back to my core story - I should be able to leave an impression in the interviewer's mind. 

its quite a mental exercise, but you can start off by crafting your own core story like ""i am a very enthu redditor who is here to change the world through my keyboard warrior skills"". every of your answers should tie back to that. once you get the fundamentals pat down, then you work to inject subtlety, wit, humour, some self-deprecation, deadpan...whatever you want.

For skin color, no. For gender, situational. Plus, it is not an equal comparison. The difference is that LGBT directly conflicts with several religious beliefs i.e. Christianity and Muslim.

&gt; No, you want LGBT people to be second-class citizens. That is reprehensible. Wanting to be treated as an equal human being is not an attack on your rights. Your rights do not supersede everyone else's.

LGBT are already treated with basic human rights, no? They aren't enslaved, and have basic rights to healthcare and other governmental services. Having the right to engage in deviant sexual behavior legally is a completely separate matter and a privilege, and honestly does not affect your life expectancy.

Why not for skin color then? If my religious beliefs say that people with darker skin are inferior and that I should not relate with them, why should I be forced to go against my beliefs?

"Fine. Benefit of the doubt. We don't grow babies to term in lab or clone humans. Some infertility problems can include partial blockage of the felopian tubes (how eggs are delivered from the ovaries to the uterus). It can also be due to decreased sperm count in the father. Sometimes it is so bad fertility treatments simply will not work.

A ""test tube baby"" is one where the father's sperm is introduced to the mother's egg, then introduced to the uterus where, if all goes well, will attach and grow as if conceived normally.

At any rate, the argument that legalizing same sex marriage is bad for the population is ridiculous. Gay couples are not going to conceive anyway because, well, they are gay couples, unless they have some surrogate to help, but under current rules, that will not happen. So that whole argument is bunk, unless you are advocating rape rooms or something to deal with a shrinking population.

As for morality, by who's standards? Supernatural rules? Objective ethics?

Priests don't reproduce since they are celibate. Hence they must be useless in the society and should be banned too.

Yes cannibalism is natural (as in we can observe it) but we consider it *immoral* - and hence illegal - because you’d have to kill someone to eat him, which we universally agree is not right in most circumstances (unless you find a random dead body to eat that doesn’t belong to someone else and doesn’t need to be cremated). 

A Homosexual relationship does not cause any more harm than a heterosexual relationship. Hence it is not immoral and should not be illegal.

There is a marked difference between homosexuality and cannibalism - so don’t try to conflate them into an argument.

"When you take this fact and cross-check with what GCT said about Edwin Tong, one wonders how much pay cut Edwin actually took to become minister.

The issue at hand is that GCT seems to be fibbing about the facts.",casual

Both Edwin Tong and Shanmugam are high flying lawyers before their appointment as minister so their pay scale we can assume is quite similar. 

Shanmugam as a full minister is getting a lot higher pay vs what Edwin is getting now so by extension if Shanmugam took a massive pay cut as a full minister, the pay cut taken by Edwin should be similar if not higher since he is getting lower a lower pay now",casual

Btw, i don't think the recommended has kicked in yet so benchmark should be 935k still. Based on this article's 11.85 months average in 2017 that'd work out to be 935/20 \* 23.85 = 1.115mil.

Basically GCT said SMS makes about 500k a year but turns out it's more than double that.",casual
"FFS. 

I was rude because i have no time for idiots. 

Firstly - Fuck you: 

&gt;Edwin Tong, he is a Senior Counsel, he earns more than $2 million. PM asked him to be a Minister of State – one quarter (salary). He came to see me. He said, at this stage of his life, he has got a house, he has got a mother-in-law to support, a father-in-law to support, his own parents and so on, what should he do? So I asked him, Edwin, what were you in politics for? (He said) Here to serve. So I said you’ve got to serve, well, you know between $2 million and perhaps half a million, later on you hopefully become a full Minister, $1 million, you have to decide which is more important. So Edwin told me his job in politics is to serve. He said yes, I will take on, and he felt very strongly that he could do the job. But now we dare not pay Ministers a good wage.

Secondly - Double fuck you

Your own link says: 


Mid-year and year-end payments paid to civil servants
based on Singapore’s economic performance. As with
current civil service practice, the AVC ranges from 0 to
1.5 months. A typical AVC is 1 month. In years of
exceptional economic performance, a one-off Special
Variable Payment can also be made.


Performance Bonus Varies with individual performance and is determined
by PM. It ranges from 0 to 6 months and good
performers will typically get 3 months.


National Bonus Based on four socio-economic indicators with equal
weights. No bonus is paid if the minimum levels of
achievement for the indicators are not met. A bonus of
3 months will be paid if the targets for the four
indicators are met. A maximum bonus of 6 months will
be paid if targets are far exceeded.

Please read your own fucking link before coming out and guai laning people. 

His pay will be around 3 months performance, 1 month AWS, 3 months National bonus.

Average minister total bonus is actually around 11 months btw. Assuming his base pay of 1 MIO it's actually pretty close to 2 MIO. 

I ALREADY FUCKING SAID THE PAY CUT MAY BE AROUND 10-20% EARLIER. NOT WHAT GCT SAID ABOUT 2 MIO VS 500K.

Ok thanks. I feel better now. 

** edit **

I am a fucking idiot and I deserve a kick in the face by you instead.",casual
"Just to clarify, the benchmark salary is not base pay but actually based on 20 months, 12 months + 13th month + 1 AVC, 3 months PB, 3 months NB. It's projected based on a average year with average bonuses included.

SMS benchmark is 935k currently, so 11.85 months bonus = 935/20 \* 23.85 = 1.115m total. Thus Tong's paycut from the claimed 2 mil would be almost 45%.

Definitely not 75%, but also not 10-20% either.",casual

I learnt something new. 

So using this logic, the base pay is actually around 500K? Which means GCT is actually not too far off. But of course not including the bonus portion is a bit sly. 

But then to be fair he probably said it off the cuff so some slack should be given. ",casual
"I don't get where 23.85&lt;- comes from

Where in the world did U get 11.85 from???

The article stated that annual salary component is 12 Months + 1 Month AWS + 3 Months performance Bonus + 3 months National Bonus(see pt 17)

Basically his annual salary is $1,020,000(I'm using the higher recommended value) which comprise of 13 months + 3 months performance and 3 months variable bonus

Actual annual + AWS is $1.2M/19 months * 13 = $697K -  65% pay cut
If we take the lower value of $935K  = $639K - 68% pay cut

While GCK was a bit off with his 75% pay cut, he wasn't that far off

Even if we assume the best case scenario where they get 100% bonus, he still took a massive 50% pay cut as opposed to your assumption of 10-20% max.

BTW average minister bonus received is 4.5 months",casual

Dude, you yourself acknowledged that there are other bonus components.... 

This is actually the reason why I hate this whole minister salary talk. It's not the quantum, it's how PAP has been trying their darnest to obfuscate facts. 

I actually admire GCT's balls to just say we need to pay ministers high pay to get quality people. This concept in itself isn't wrong, but perhaps the implementation does leave something to be desired. 

Case in point, I'm not very convinced that Edwin Tong or Son of Punggol are actually quality. Same goes for CCS. ",casual
"Okay, the annual salary component = 12 months + 1 AVC + 3 PB + 3 NB. Plus one more month for 13th month.

\&gt; The annual salaries comprise fixed pay of 13 months (monthly salary and 13th month bonus) and variable pay of 7 months (1 month AVC, 3 months Performance Bonus and 3 months National Bonus).

The benchmark of either 935k or 1.02mil is based on 20 months salary. In the OP article there's a table allegedly from PSD that gives the actual bonuses at 11.85 months for 2017 average. (It's the 2nd table in the article)

23.85 = 12 months basic + 11.85 months bonus. (13th mo + 4.5 PB + 1.5 AVC + 5.25 NB)

Your actual annual is based on absolutely no bonuses paid out at all, i.e. pure 13 months salary, in which the figures are almost correct but not quite because you're dividing by 19 when it should be 20 (cos' it includes 13th month).

The average minister bonus received being 4.5months is solely  for Performance bonus (PB component), and does not include the alleged 1.5 months AVC or 5.25 months NB, nor the 13th month.

So it depends on whether your definition of actual annual salary means just basic fixed pay or included bonuses. If the former, then yes about 600k, if the latter then more than 1mil.",casual

Fact is the guy was wrong. He claim that Edwin Tong at best took a 10-20% pay cut. Assuming the info that Edwin Tong's previous salary as a lawyer is $2M. His base pay as a SMS is plus AWS is $690K representing a 68% pay cut. At the very best if he get full bonus his salary is cap at $1.02M he would still be seeing his salary halved

&amp;#x200B;

If you argue that this is a public good to teach about homosexuality, does everyone feels that it a public good? I certainly dont, especially when taught to young kids. Besides, public policy is primarily guided by majority rule. There will be way more opposition to teaching homosexuality to kids, than teaching about the different races/religions.

It does not matter what religious institutions and parents teach their kids. Parents have every damn right to impart whatever moral values they deem fit to their kids. That does not mean you get to introduce homosexuality into children's education to act as a counterweight to those moral values that you dont share. Absurd.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's put it this way, parents may teach polygamy is immoral to their kids. And this may lead to society having a negative image of polygamists. So shall we teach children about polygamists, that there is nothing wrong with it? Same logic with promiscuously and pornography.

"&gt;Still, how does it affect you again? 

Because i see it as promotion of homosexual lifestyle and behviour under the guise of equality. There is simply no need to subject children to homosexual education, and the LGBT community's insistence on doing so is what leads people to feel there is some surreptitious agenda about the movement

Its not discrimination. He should have the liberty to determine in which events he wants to participate in, for which ceremonies he wants to use his artistic skills in.

And he did suffer a backlash, he has gotten death threats. And when the courts forced him to bake cakes for all occassions, he had to drop the service completely and lose 40% of his revenue.

&amp;#x200B;

The gay couple purposefully seeked out a business that would reject baking a cake for their wedding, so they can make a big hoo haa of it. All the baker did was excercise his liberty to not bake a cake, he even claimed they could buy a cake off his shelf.

&amp;#x200B;

The idea that teens (on the cusp of adulthood) should not be taught actual facts about sexuality just because you disagree with it is ludicrous. For someone who's a libertarian, I have no idea how you can even support active educational censorship.

&gt;They probably dont want to bake a cake for a neonazi gathering or KKK cross burning either. How is it practical to advertise all the various events the baker will not take part in

It's a wedding cake. There are two types of weddings. It's not really hard to be honest about it.

&gt;Its not discrimination. He should have the liberty to determine in which events he wants to participate in, for which ceremonies he wants to use his artistic skills in.

Okay then, I hope you support businesses having the liberty to not serve those who are religious.

&gt;The gay couple purposefully seeked out a business that would reject baking a cake for their wedding, so they can make a big hoo haa of it. All the baker did was excercise his liberty to not bake a cake, he even claimed they could buy a cake off his shelf.

How would they purposefully seek it out if it's not advertised?

'How is it practical to advertise all the various events the baker will not take part in' - /u/MatrixTwo

&gt;Tell ""You can't have you cake and eat it too"" to your fellow far-left and LGBT friends. They cannot demand for liberty and rights while simultaneously trying to infringe on other's

That's a silly argument, because this business opened in the US that has the Federal Civil Rights Act. If you're not willing to abide by the laws in place, then don't open a business. I'm not sure how someone who broke the law is an actual victim.

"&gt;Why is it fine to teach religion to children but not about sexuality (age appropriate, of course)?

&amp;#x200B;

Well i wouldnt be mad if religious education got removed (Besides we haven't taught religious education to kids since it was removed some time ago). And i definetly will be wary of those who insist that their religion should be taught to kids.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway teaching religious education is not the same as teaching homosexuality.

We are not telling kids its okay to be of religion X or religion Y, or that such people exist. It has to do with cultural awareness, so that kids who grow up to be adults learn how to conduct themselves among the different religious people, be aware of their sensitives etc.

&amp;#x200B;

There is absolutely no need to introduce homosexuality to kids, why should we confuse kids about their sexuality at such an age? Let them grow and figure it out for themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And Tango Make Three is a very good example of this.

&amp;#x200B;

I would put more responsibility on the parents to ensure they vet through the books before allowing the children to borrow them.

&amp;#x200B;

However, nlb didnt remove it, they moved it to the adult section under the directions of a minister. They are a public library funded by taxpayers. Public policy have to reflect a certain level of majority will. If the majority of people believe in traditional family values and do not think exposure to homosexuality is age-appropriate for children, then thats how public institutions are going to act.

&amp;#x200B;

Hmm isnt there some sex education at primary? Anyway teens around the age of 15 are children too. Their parents still have a right to not expose them to homosexuality education, especially when there is no need to.

&amp;#x200B;

Ehh i said i was a Libertarian on that issue, not in all. Even then a libertarian would rather a parent have some control over their kid’s education than a gov forcing knowledge on their children.

&amp;#x200B;

Funny how your brand it as censorship of facts. There are certain things that are appropriate to teach to children and some are not. We don’t teach about the facts of open relationships, polygamy or masturbation. Is it censorship then?

I can flip it around and see your insistence as a promotion of homosexual culture and lifestyle to kids. A libertarian certainly would want that forced into his kid.

He makes cakes for various ceremonies and occassions. He had denied other requests before, Halloween, divorce celebrations, bachelor parties etc.

Because he is known for refusing to participate in events that conflict with his religious views

&gt;That's a silly argument, because this business opened in the US that has the Federal Civil Rights Act. If you're not willing to abide by the laws in place, then don't open a business. I'm not sure how someone who broke the law is an actual victim.

&amp;#x200B;

You can cite anti-discrimination laws until you are blue in the face, it doesn’t matter, it wasn’t discrimination.

&amp;#x200B;

**Nobody was denied service based on their identity!!!**. The gay couple could have asked for a cake for their birthday, they would have got it. A straight couple could have asked a wedding cake for their friends gay wedding, they would be denied. So how can you pin discrimination on this?

&amp;#x200B;

You know whats funny, there was another case brought in front of the Col Commission, William jack vs azucar bakery. He wanted the bakery to write the quote “Homosexuality is a detestable sin” on a cake, but he was denied. He then sued but lost, the commission found that the bakery did not discriminate

&amp;#x200B;

So refusing to write biblical verses on the cake? Not discrimination. Refusing to bake a cake for a gay wedding? Discrimination!!!!

&amp;#x200B;

The fuck?

&amp;#x200B;

Should that  bakery have acceded? Of course not. i support the commissions stance in this instance, the business has a right to refuse to create a specific cake.

"I actually worked indirectly for ninjavan as a delivery assistant with my friend who was one of their contractors. They are paid pretty shit, it's $2-$2.30 per successfully delivered listing shown on the app, compared to other delivery companies that pay $2-$3 per parcel regardless of whether it was delivered or not. 

Anyways, because of this, the drivers would just want to deliver the parcel regardless of whether or not someone is at home. Especially if the parcel was HUGE, like a vacuum or a 24 pack of beer or a freaking 60"" TV. so what we would do is if nobody is at home we'd try to slot the parcel between the gate/door, or hide it somewhere like behind some potted plants. huge parcels bobian need to call and ask if it's okay to leave at the door or something. 

our standard protocol was to call twice and if the recipient didn't pick up we can fail the parcel under 'nobody at home to receive'. some of the drivers who want to rush through the day will just fake the calls. (just call but immediately end so it doesn't go through on the other end)

cash on delivery parcels were the worst. almost 70% of the time we had people claiming that they already paid for the parcel, why need to pay again etc etc and time would be wasted explaining that hey I have no idea I'm just here to deliver your parcel. after that still have to wait for them to decide if they want to pay for the parcel or not.

fun times. would not do again.

There is even the possibility that his ""buddies"" made it more ""challenging"" (as they do in such silly orientation/ragging/ORD ceremonies) by doing things like blindfolding him or tying his hands/legs up before throwing him into the well. These are items that they could have removed and swore to stay quiet about after they retrieved his body but before the proper investigative authorities arrived.

There is also the question of with what severe force and how awkwardly they threw him into the well.

--- 

I have now just read the very brief Press Release/PDF and the above are all questions that were not addressed. 

Instead, all we have are amazingly precise timings of when he was pushed in (9:07pm), when someone first jumped in to rescue him (8 seconds after), and when his body was extracted (9:43pm).

Yet not a word about what exactly they were doing **before** he was pushed in (other than that they presented him with a plaque and had some cake) or the severity of the force with which he was thrown in.

Also if the SG uniform is anything like the US uniform it feels like it clings to your skin when soaked and that could also make you panic more because it feels like your chest is being compressed and it adds a lot of weight that you have to keep above the water.

"**Cold shock response**

Cold shock response is the physiological response of organisms to sudden cold, especially cold water.

In humans, cold shock response is perhaps the most common cause of death from immersion in very cold water, such as by falling through thin ice. The immediate shock of the cold causes involuntary inhalation, which if underwater can result in drowning. The cold water can also cause heart attack due to vasoconstriction; the heart has to work harder to pump the same volume of blood throughout the body.

AFAIK, I don't think there is a very harsh punishment like life sentence or death when it comes to military law unless you really really big time fuck up like crimes against the state itself or something of equal magnitude.

It's a very complicated matter. Years and years of vicious cycle where hazing is basically tradition and peer pressure, guys being stupid and upbringing where guys are supposed to be tougher than they look and they forget that there are guys who are actually quite brittle. Just a series of unfortunate events leading up to this incident, you can't just undo what has been done for years overnight. If you charge every single person who has been involved, I'm sure at least a quarter of our defence force would be in DB. To them, it's just their luck they have a ""weaker"" (lack of a better word) victim to haze where any other person would have survived the ordeal just fine.

I'm sure there were hazings far worse than this in the past and nobody died then, and the older generation definitely have the ""back in my day people ate literal shit and didn't die from diseases "" speech with their own millennials children (us) and this definitely contributed to the kind of mentality where people expect us not to die from this level of hazing just because your dad had been through worse. It just takes one incident like this to let the hazing get banned for a bit but inevitably they all move on and forget and we get another case like this 2-3 years down the road.

Oh boy, you just opened a can of worms on yourself, prepare for the downvotes (I'm not gonna downvote you). How successful Singapore is today can partly be credited to NS imho. The hazing tradition is bad, but let's not discredit the many, many benefits NS has brought for us and the state. 

Just to name a few:

- The camaraderie literally every guy who went through NS in Singapore share. From 50 years ago where the first conscription started, till today, we all met the same kind of people and been through the same kind of shit. You can go up to an uncle on the street and talk about NS, and have a decent amount of conversation, despite being complete strangers.

- Some level of patriotism was inculcated during NS and definitely make me wanna strive for Singapore and not any other country, for me at least.

- Singapore's only natural resource is our people, we don't have natural mountains to dig, land to build tons of reservoirs for water etc. People are literally our only strong point, and NS brings guys of every race/religion, shape or size together and bond for 2 years. You don't see racial/religion intolerance in Singapore for a reason, and NS contributes some parts of that.

- personal health benefits, I'm sure Singapore young male adults are of the healthier ones among the young male adults of the world because of NS. I'm sure even our slightly weaker PES brothers can kick the asses of the others any time of the day.

I could go on and on about why we need NS. As a recently ORD-ed NSMen, yeah conscription sucks major dick and it sucks having to be the one to go through NS, but it sure is necessary af for both ourselves and the nation.

A very candid point, but let's look at the definition of rape as specified by Singapore Law:


'Any man who penetrates the vagina or a woman with his penis (a) without her consent; or (b) with or without her consent, when she is under 14 years of age, shall be guilty of an offence.'


Let's just ignore (b) to debate this point.


The thing about


&gt;paedophilia, necrophilia and zoophilia


is simply that none of the victims (for lack of a better word) in the aforementioned categories are in any capacity to provide consent. That's why it's called statutory **rape**.

That said, it’s nice to have an intellectual debate for once. ",casual
"&gt;Yes, your argument is fully on point. 
&gt;Therein lies mine, it isn’t paedophilia if it’s not underage, maybe we should repeal all laws regarding sexual intercourse with minors because they are born this way? 


I don't see the logic behind that. The issue at hand regarding homosexual intercourse is not one of consent. Paedophilia, necrophilia and Zoophilia is. 


Just because you are homosexual  doesn't mean you can have sex with any person you want. You still have to seek consent first.


When you argue for paedophilia to be legal (I'm not saying you do btw, just an expression), the main debate isn't about your sexual preferences. The problem is that the other party legally cannot provide consent.


People under a certain age (The actual age is a topic irrelevant to the discussion at hand) legally *cannot* give consent. Same goes for corpses and animals. 


Sex of any nature with a party that is legally incapable of providing consent is rape. This applies to everyone regardless of your sexual orientation.


Your argument is a red herring, not a slippery slope. 


&gt;How is the law evil? The law seeks to protect the natural order. If legislators find that there is a new natural order and decide to repeal the law, then so be it. 


The Law isn't inherently evil, but there are evil people who wish to impose their will upon others through it. ",casual
